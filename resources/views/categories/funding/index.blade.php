<h4><em><strong>Securing funding for your small business is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. We look at how a personal touch can make the journey that much less stressful.</strong></em></h4>
<p>Looking for funding as a small business might appear to be a complex and overwhelming expedition. Finding an advisory ﬁrm that is exactly the right ﬁt is vital. For many small businesses, a smaller ﬁrm provides the personal touch and value for money they need, simplifying the funding process and providing a holistic approach. While larger corporations might have a greater range of expertise, smaller advisories can often provide a more tailored approach to each speciﬁc situation.&nbsp;In this article, we look at the journey towards funding that a small advisory will take with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>To begin, your advisor will assist you in preparing to get your business funding ready. This means everything from making sure that your compliance and statutory affairs are in order to ensure your business results’ reflected ability to be funded and your projections and business strategy are in alignment in terms of how you plan to win in the market in the future. Included in this process is a status quo assessment of your small business’s current performance and future expectations. It is also at this stage that a smaller advisory will spend time getting to know you and your business on a more intimate level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Strategic Approach</h2>
<p>From here, the advisor will assist in devising an appropriate funding strategy guided by what is appropriate for your individual business bearing in mind your desired outcome. With this funding strategy, your advisory will identify and assist you in approaching an appropriate target of funders for your specific type of funding. In-depth knowledge of you and your business will allow the advisory to save time and effort by narrowing down the list of prospective funders to those most likely to show an interest in your enterprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Managing Destination Expectations</h2>
<p>Along the way, a smaller firm will manage your expectations at every turn. While larger corporations might give you an inflated sense of what the outcome of your funding journey might be, smaller firms with a deeper insight into your anticipated outcomes will give you a more realistic view with regards to the cost of funding, and the type of funding and what collateral is required.<br><br></p>
<h5><strong><em>“People come in thinking any bank will fund them, any equity partner will buy into their business immediately and at the price that they think it’s worth. It’s our job to give an honest assessment of a client’s current situation and future trajectory, mapping out ideal solutions to help them achieve their plans,” says Ross Smith of Siyakha’s Capital Advisory division.<br><br></em></strong></h5>
<h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
<p>A smaller advisory might be willing to take on challenging transactions and might even work on a successful outcome factor so that their cost varies depending on their ability to help you succeed. After all, why pay a tour operator if you don’t reach your destination? This approach ensures that your chosen advisory will not only walk the journey with you but will steer you around obstacles and see the journey through to the end, not giving up along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Destination Anywhere</h2>
<p>As with any journey, it’s important to choose your travel companion carefully, taking time to research small and large firms to see which will fit your personal and business personality. If you choose well, the sky really is the limit</p>

<p>A recent research article published by the B-BBEE Commissioner clearly shows that Enterprise and Supplier Development systems are not working optimally.</p>
<p>We have long discussed this as a team – and this year marks 25 years in&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.siyakha.co.za/">Siyakha</a>’s</strong>&nbsp;history and 21 years in our delivery of SMME and Community Development solutions.</p>
<p>The over-emphasis on “funding” solutions is often an indication of the absence of strong financial management. Last year our team undertook a mock exercise to apply for SMME funding across a multitude of SMME specialist funders.</p>
<p>The finding in all instances except two, was that SMME funding follows pretty much the same credit criteria as corporate funding. This means that entities that lack strong balance sheets and established financials will pay a premium which they can ill afford.</p>
<p>Our overwhelming findings in SMME development are that there are two areas where every small business needs support and assistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is what might be termed “commercial” –<strong>&nbsp;financial management, pricing, negotiating supplier contracts, legal agreements with clients, governance, and compliance.</strong>&nbsp;In essence, all of these things drive business viability and longevity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second is&nbsp;<strong>sales</strong>. This includes a good elevator pitch, daily sales calls, simple but great proposals and a developed brand. It also involves using social media to support business visibility, having the basic tools for a strong corporate identity, and understanding when and how to use them to support the sales process.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Solid commercials and a sales strategy, added to a great entrepreneurial mindset, are the essential ingredients. They may remove the need for funding altogether and certainly minimise the risks associated with funding.</p>
